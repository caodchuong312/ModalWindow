        [Verse 1] I let my soul fall into you I never thought I'd fall right
        through I fell for every word you said You made me feel I needed you And
        forced my heart to think it's true But I found I'm powerless with you
        [Chorus] Now I don't need your wings to fly No, I don't need a hand to
        hold in mine this time You held me down, but I broke free I found the
        love inside of me Now I don't need a hero to survive Cause I already
        saved my life Cause I already saved my life [Verse 2] I fell into your
        fantasy But that's all our love will ever be I lost hope in saving you
        and me You think I'm lost, falling apart But your lies just made a
        stronger heart My life is just about to start [Chorus] Now I don't need
        your wings to fly No, I don't need a hand to hold in mine this time You
        held me down, but I broke free I found the love inside of me Now I don't
        need a hero to survive Cause I already saved my life Already saved my
        life I already saved my life Already saved my life I already saved my
        life
